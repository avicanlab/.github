## About Us

Bacterial infections are linked to high human morbidity and death rates and antibiotic-resistant bacteria are becoming a more widespread concern. Aside from their virulence strategies, diverse bacterial pathogens are extremely capable of adapting to stressful host environments. They sense and respond to stressors by re-programming their transcriptome with complex regulatory networks for maintenance of infection. Therefore, bacterial stress responses can be potential targets for novel antimicrobial strategies. We aim to retrieve novel knowledge of bacterial tissue adaptation mechanisms and identify bacterial gene products which can be used as potential antimicrobial targets in combatting bacterial infections.​
